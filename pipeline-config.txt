In the Previous Project - "awsDevOps-TF-Pipeline" we have created a very simple terraform Pipeline in AWS with the agenda of acheiving below:
1. CodeCommit repository with a simple backend.tf (we has created a s3 backend bucket manually for state file) and provider.tf files - with just to have state file in backend S3 bucket.
2. Created Just One Simple CodeBuild Project (with image & terraform build spec commands) to execute terraform apply for terraform code created in CodeCommit repository.
3. Create One CodePipeline and connected to CodeCommit repository & CodeBuild Project. And Pipeline just created a state file in S3 backedn bucket.
And once this is setup - we can just simply provision our resources like a S3 bucket, EC2 etc and commit in CodeCommit Repository & CodePipeline will run to Provision the resources.

In this Project, we will learn:
1. To create three CodeBuild Projects - plan, apply and destroy.
2. Create a CodePipeline and execute those three build projects using this CodePipeline.
3. We are going to use terraform source code in this example as creating EC2 resource. Like above Project we are also going to have a backend s3 bucket for state files, we have to create manually prior doing next steps.
4.
